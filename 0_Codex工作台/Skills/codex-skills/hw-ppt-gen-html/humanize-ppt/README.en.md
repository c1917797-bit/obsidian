# Humanize PPT

> *A template library can spread one concept across a dozen pretty HTML pages. What you have to stand up and deliver is the line that pushes the audience forward, one page at a time.*

**A presentation system, born for the talk.** Good-looking templates are everywhere; what's missing is the line that lets you *deliver* one. Humanize uses AST (audience-state-transfer) to weave material into that line, assigns real images, SVG diagrams, or Remotion clips where needed, and runs a presentation checkup after rendering. The result can be an HTML presenter mode with its visual system intact or a native, element-editable PPTX with speaker notes. The downstream skill still renders the deck natively: it paints each page, Humanize makes it deliverable on stage.

## Install in 30s

Have your agent (Codex / Claude Code / Hermes …) install Humanize PPT — simplest is to hand it the GitHub link:

```text
Please install the Humanize PPT Skill: https://github.com/LearnPrompt/humanize-ppt
```

Or one line of npx:

```bash
npx skills add LearnPrompt/humanize-ppt -g
```

Claude Code users can use the plugin marketplace (auto-updates):

```text
/plugin marketplace add LearnPrompt/humanize-ppt
/plugin install humanize-ppt
```

**To run the whole flow, install this set of downstream skills too** (Humanize writes the outline and decisions; they render and produce assets):

| Skill | Role | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `guizang-ppt-skill` | Chinese deck native render (magazine / Swiss) | [op7418/guizang-ppt-skill](https://github.com/op7418/guizang-ppt-skill) |
| `frontend-slides` | English deck native render (viewport-safe HTML) | [zarazhangrui/frontend-slides](https://github.com/zarazhangrui/frontend-slides) |
| `beautiful-html-templates` | English deck multi-template render | [zarazhangrui/beautiful-html-templates](https://github.com/zarazhangrui/beautiful-html-templates) |
| `ppt-master` | Native editable PPTX (DrawingML, notes, transitions, raw `.pptx` template fill) | [hugohe3/ppt-master](https://github.com/hugohe3/ppt-master) |
| `remotion-video-production` | Per-page explainer video (real mp4), orchestrates the whole pipeline | Remotion (see pairing below) |
| `baoyu-image-gen` | Images via the local Codex CLI (**no API key**) | [JimLiu/baoyu-skills](https://github.com/JimLiu/baoyu-skills/tree/main/skills/baoyu-image-gen) |

**How to pair the Remotion skills** (a bit of hard-won experience): default to `remotion-video-production` to orchestrate the pipeline, paired with `remotion-best-practices` while writing code to avoid unstable patterns (misused CSS / Tailwind animation, wrong asset paths); for complex work — captions, charts, 3D, batch templates, automated render pipelines — add [`remotion-video-toolkit`](https://github.com/shreefentsar/remotion-video-toolkit).

One line to the agent: "Install humanize-ppt plus the renderer I need (guizang/frontend-slides/beautiful-html-templates for HTML, or ppt-master for native PowerPoint); add baoyu-image-gen and Remotion only when the deck needs those assets."

## Use it in one line

Once installed, run the whole flow with one message — copy-paste it to your agent:

```text
Use humanize-ppt to turn this material into an English presentation deck: produce
the AST outline and per-page intent, render natively with frontend-slides (or
beautiful-html-templates), use baoyu-image-gen for images and remotion for video,
then run the presentation checkup and tell me which pages can't be presented, and
finish with presenter mode.
```

For Chinese, swap in "Chinese + guizang-ppt-skill". CLI flags, staged control, and re-injection commands live in [Advanced usage](#advanced-usage) below — beginners can skip them.

For a PowerPoint deck that stays editable element-by-element, ask Humanize to define the AST, delegate native rendering to `ppt-master`, then feed the PPTX back into the presentation checkup. Humanize writes `ppt-master-production-prompt.md`; PPT Master keeps its mandatory confirmation and native export gates.

## What it solves

I give a fair number of talks. Every time I reached for one of those gorgeous HTML PPT skills I hit the same wall: **they're built for concept display** — a single idea balloons into a dozen pages, but a 90-minute talk tops out around thirty. The pretty shell runs ahead of the content density; the pages look great and the line doesn't hold.

Humanize PPT fills that gap. It doesn't take over the template's "renders beautifully" job — it turns *beautiful* into *deliverable*:

1. **AST outline — every page turn teaches the audience something.** AST = Audience-State-Transfer. I fed an AI 70+ TED talks and had it distill how a talk carries an audience forward, page by page. Humanize weaves your material into that line: each turn should move the audience to understand a concept, not pile on information.
2. **Visual enhancement — the pages that need a picture get a real one.** Per page it decides image / SVG diagram / video and hands the plan to downstream: images via `baoyu-image-gen` (local Codex CLI, no key), video via Remotion, data figures as deterministic SVG. Both the Chinese (guizang) and English paths have image generation wired in.
3. **Automatic presentation checkup — stop hunting for the broken page.** Text covered by a badge used to mean a back-and-forth with Codex to find which page. Better to let the checkup scan it all at once after render and tell you which page, what's wrong, how to fix.
4. **Presenter mode — what ships is something you can take on stage.** Human feel, a speaker script, the state transition per page, and the HTML beauty kept intact.

The boundary is clear: **the full deck is rendered natively by the downstream renderer**; Humanize doesn't copy its template or touch rendered HTML/PPTX. Humanize directs the talk; downstream paints each page.

If you see `humanize-ppt-team` inside WorkBuddy, treat it as a multi-agent packaging of the same core: AST outline, media decisions, renderer hand-off, presenter mode, and checkup split across specialist agents. It is not a separate monolithic renderer. Chinese positioning note: [WorkBuddy Team vs Humanize PPT](docs/workbuddy-team-vs-humanize-ppt.md).

## Presentation checkup

First, what a failed page is: one with only a few words that never finishes its point; or one that doesn't complete the audience state transfer it promised, so the listener leaves it in the same state they arrived. Such pages shouldn't exist. HTML's variety is seductive — it's easy to ship a deck where a page says nothing. That's made for looking at, not presenting.

The checkup grades the outline, not the beauty: it diffs each rendered page against its outline page. The failure-mode catalog is in [references/qa-failure-modes.md](references/qa-failure-modes.md) ([中文](references/qa-failure-modes.md)), each mode with "what the audience sees." Things the static scan can't catch (text overflow, badge occlusion, the WebGL-cover static-screenshot trap) are honestly listed as "can't catch yet" and backstopped by screenshot review — leave it empty before staging a fake.

## Visual enhancement

Humanize decides per page whether it needs an image / SVG diagram / video and writes it into `slide_plan.json`'s `media` slots (with `asset_path` + `prompt_hint`); the downstream skill produces the real file at that path. The generator is hot-pluggable; recommended:

- **image**: `baoyu-image-gen` via the **local Codex CLI** (`--provider codex-cli`, uses the logged-in ChatGPT subscription, **no OPENAI_API_KEY**). Use it for atmospheric / concept / hero visuals — pretty and key-free; keep precise-text or data figures as deterministic SVG (image models garble exact labels).
- **video**: Remotion renders a `duration_s`-second deterministic loop (no narration).
- **diagram**: deterministic inline SVG / HTML, zero dependency, no external call.

v0.9 filled all 8 media slots of one deck with real assets ([production record](docs/showcase/v0.9-visual-enhancement/media-production-2026-06-17.md)): a real codex hero image + 2 real Remotion mp4s + a real screenshot + deterministic SVGs — proving the slots are real tasks and every generator class plugs in.

## Style gallery

Don't make people pick a style blind. HTML renderers use Humanize's ≥4 real-cover gallery. PPT Master already owns a three-stage Confirm UI with native visual-style previews, so `--renderer ppt-master --style-gallery` delegates to that native gate instead of creating four speculative projects. See [references/style-gallery-spec.md](references/style-gallery-spec.md) and the [PPT Master bridge](adapters/ppt-master-bridge-notes.md).

## Outline preview

Since v0.7 Humanize has its own screenshot-able working draft (not a deck): the audience state-transfer map. Input `slide_plan.json`, output a zero-dependency HTML page — one row per slide ("page → state the audience walks in with → page intent → state they walk out with") plus a top-line state arc. Five minutes before rendering to spot which page stalls.

<p align="center">
  <img src="examples/04-preview-outline-ai-tool-update/preview-outline.png" width="92%" />
</p>

## Presenter mode

What ships is a talk you can take on stage, not a stack of static pages: per-page speaker script, state transitions, HTML beauty kept. Humanize now writes `outputs/presenter/presenter-shell.html` directly from `slide_plan.json` + `speaker_intent.md`, so you still get a usable presenter shell before any downstream deck exists. Downstream template skills can still provide richer native presenter consoles once the final deck is rendered; Humanize owns "what each page says", the template owns "how the final stage renders."

## Advanced usage

<details>
<summary><b>CLI flags, staged control, style selection, fix-prompt details</b> (beginners can skip)</summary>

### Brief mode (default)

```bash
python3 scripts/humanize_ppt.py \
  --source examples/01-ai-tool-update/source.md \
  --out .humanize-ppt-runs/ai-tool-update \
  --title "AI 工具更新，不只是功能清单" \
  --renderer guizang --guizang-style A --guizang-theme ink-classic
```

Produces `guizang-production-prompt.md` for `guizang-ppt-skill` to render. For English, set `--renderer` to `frontend-slides` or `beautiful-html-templates`.

Native editable PPTX:

```bash
python3 scripts/humanize_ppt.py \
  --source examples/01-ai-tool-update/source.md \
  --out .humanize-ppt-runs/ai-tool-update-pptx \
  --title "AI Tool Updates Beyond the Changelog" \
  --renderer ppt-master \
  --ppt-master-transition fade
```

This writes `ppt-master-production-prompt.md` and `ppt-master-source.md`. Add `--ppt-master-template <template.pptx>` for PPT Master's deterministic native `template-fill-pptx` route; a raw PPTX is never misread as an SVG template directory.

Humanize auto-detects Python 3.10+ and records the verified interpreter in the handoff. Use `--ppt-master-python <python>` to pin it; do not assume a command named `python3` is new enough.

### Style gallery (cover gate before the outline)

```bash
python3 scripts/humanize_ppt.py --source examples/01-ai-tool-update/source.md \
  --out .humanize-ppt-runs/ai-tool-update --title "..." --renderer guizang --style-gallery
```

Produces `style_gallery.html` + `style_gallery_plan.json` + one "cover only" command per candidate. `--gallery-count` defaults to 4, min 4.

### Presentation checkup (after rendering)

```bash
python3 scripts/humanize_ppt.py --qa-from <rendered.html> \
  --out <prior out dir> --renderer guizang --guizang-style A --max-qa-iterations 3
```

Produces `qa_report.md` / `fix_prompt.md` / `qa_iteration.json`, capped at 3 rounds, `needs-human` if not converged. `fix_prompt.md` goes back to the downstream skill — never post-process the HTML in Humanize.

For PPT Master, point `--qa-from` at `<native-deck.pptx>` and use `--renderer ppt-master`. The checkup inspects OOXML package integrity, page count, editable objects, speaker notes, AST drift, relationships, and transitions; rendered visual collisions remain PPT Master's own SVG/browser gate.

### Image / video / outline preview

```bash
# image: local Codex CLI, no key
bun ~/.agents/skills/baoyu-image-gen/scripts/main.ts \
  --prompt "..." --image assets/s01-image.png --provider codex-cli --ar 16:9

# outline preview (audience state-transfer map)
python3 scripts/preview_outline_html.py \
  --slide-plan <out>/slide_plan.json --out <out>/preview-outline.html --title "..."

# demo GIF (record the working drafts into a moving GIF)
python3 scripts/record_demo_gif.py --source examples/01-ai-tool-update/source.md \
  --title "..." --out docs/showcase/demo.gif --covers-dir <real-covers-dir>
```

</details>

## What it does

- **AST outline**: audience, state transfer, page intent, speaking rhythm — every turn moves understanding forward.
- **Visual enhancement**: per-page image / SVG / video, produced downstream via baoyu-image-gen / Remotion / deterministic SVG.
- **Style gallery**: ≥4 cover candidates before the outline, each rendered downstream, picked in a zero-dependency gallery.
- **Outline preview**: the audience state-transfer map from `slide_plan.json`, reviewed before any render.
- **Presentation checkup**: per-page outline diff after render, scans failure modes, writes fix prompts, capped at 3 rounds.
- **Presenter mode**: writes `outputs/presenter/presenter-shell.html` directly from `slide_plan.json` + `speaker_intent.md` — usable standalone before the downstream deck exists; downstream native consoles can take over the full stage view once the deck is ready.

## How it differs

| | Template skill alone | **Humanize PPT** |
|---|---|---|
| Start | Material straight into a template | Ask who the audience is and what state they should leave in (AST) |
| Density | One idea spread over a dozen pretty pages | Woven into a deliverable line, each page moving the state |
| Assets | Whatever the template ships | Per-page image/SVG/video decided and handed downstream |
| Render | Renders itself | Native downstream render, zero imitation |
| Quality | Ships on render | Automatic presentation checkup, 3 rounds, fix prompts |

In a line: the template renders beautifully; Humanize makes it deliverable, watched, and stage-ready. Upstream and downstream, not competitors.

## Verified downstream paths

The Humanize brief is plain markdown + JSON, so it works with both HTML-PPT skills and native PPTX workflows:

| Renderer | Status | Verified |
|---|---|---|
| `guizang-ppt-skill` (Chinese) | full chain | brief + checkup on real rendered output; 7 guizang-specific failure-mode rules |
| `beautiful-html-templates` (English) | full chain | brief exit + a full checkup on a real Neo-Grid deck on 2026-06-13 (found a badge covering 9 pages → fixed → re-check passed, [log](docs/showcase/hermes-agent-mastery/en/qa/presentation-checkup-2026-06-13.md)) |
| `frontend-slides` (English) | full chain | brief exit + a full checkup on a real 5-page deck on 2026-06-17 (scan pass + negative control + screenshot review, [log](docs/showcase/v0.9-frontend-slides/qa/presentation-checkup-2026-06-17.md)) |
| `ppt-master` (native PPTX) | full chain | real main SVG + raw template-fill routes; the main-route deck had 10 slides and 399 editable containers, while the 5-slide template-fill deck had 199 editable containers and passed an independent office open/render gate; both completed notes, Fade transitions, and Humanize PPTX checkup ([record](docs/showcase/ppt-master-native/verification-2026-07-10.md)) |

English and Chinese are now both `full`: brief exit works + checkup verified on real output + image generation wired in + renderer-specific failure modes recorded. Guizang has 7 Style A/B rules; the English pair now add 5 static rules for horizontal overflow, low contrast, hyphenation noise, missing font contracts, and missing image alt text. Screenshot review remains part of the process for occlusion, clipping, and visual alignment failures that static HTML cannot prove.

## Why AST

- **Audience**: who's listening, what they know, what they resist.
- **State**: where they start, where the deck should move them.
- **Transfer**: how each page drives that transfer.

> PPT is not an information container. PPT is an audience state-transfer artifact.

See [AST Theory](docs/AST-theory.md), [SPEC.md](SPEC.md), [v1.1 PPT Master Release Notes](docs/versions/v1.1.0-ppt-master.md), and [v1.0 Release Notes](docs/versions/v1.0.0-full-english-presenter.md).

## Safety

- Never copies or post-processes the downstream skill's rendered HTML/PPTX; render problems always become a fix prompt sent back downstream;
- All-local scripts, zero API, zero key (images use the local Codex CLI subscription); no material content leaves the machine;
- The checkup stops at 3 rounds and flags `needs-human` rather than retrying forever;
- No private paths, accounts, or credentials in the brief or examples.
